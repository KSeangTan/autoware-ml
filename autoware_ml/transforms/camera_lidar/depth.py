    """Project the lidar points onto every camera into sparse depth maps.

    The depth maps are stored in ``camera_image_data.depth_images`` with the resolution of the
    images. A pixel hit by a lidar point holds the depth of that point along the camera's
    optical axis, every other pixel is zero.

    ``lidar2images`` already contains the image-space augmentations applied earlier in the
    pipeline, as the loading and image transforms keep it in sync with ``images``, so the
    points are projected with it directly and an identity image augmentation matrix. Hence
    this transform must run after every transform that changes the image geometry.

    Required keys:
        - ``point_cloud_data``: points with at least XYZ columns.
        - ``camera_image_data``: images and their ``lidar2images`` projections.

    Optional keys:
